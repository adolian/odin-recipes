    <h3><em>This is the best rice</em></h3>
    <p>
      White rice cooked with a little flavorful oil and chopped onion, and then
      simmered with broth. It`s one step up from rice cooked in water, but not
      so elaborate that you can`t pull it together on a weeknight.
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>2 tablespoons butter</li>
      <li>½ cup orzo pasta</li>
      <li>½ cup diced onion</li>
      <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
      <li>½ cup uncooked white rice</li>
      <li>2 cups chicken broth</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Melt butter in a skillet over medium-low heat. Add orzo; cook and stir
        until orzo is golden brown.
      </li>
      <li>
        Stir in onion and cook until onion becomes translucent. Add garlic and
        cook for 1 minute. Stir in rice and chicken broth, turn heat to high,
        and bring to a boil.
      </li>
      <li>
        Reduce heat to medium-low, cover the skillet, and simmer until rice is
        tender and liquid has been absorbed, 20 to 25 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Remove from the heat and let stand, covered, for 5 minutes. Fluff with a
        fork before serving.
      </li>
    </ol>
